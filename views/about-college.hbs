        <h3>Cricket Association of Nepal is the official governing body of cricket in Nepal. It was suspended from 2016 to 13 October 2019 due to governmental interference.
             The ICC welcomed the elections of the board held in September 2019 and formally reinstated the board on a conditional basis on 14 October.</h3>
        <h3>The board was dissolved by the government of Nepal in November 2014 on the grounds of incompetence and a three-member ad hoc committee was established with a new president designated by the government itself.[4] In April 2016, CAN was suspended by the ICC, on the grounds of government interference in its operations.
